Use the following tools appropriately.\n\n### Development State Management\n\nWhen development phase or work focus changes, always update the state with `change_context` tool.\n\n**When to Use**:\n- Phase transitions (development→testing, testing→debugging, etc.)\n- Work focus changes (API implementation→authentication, etc.)\n\n**Effect**: After state change, this instruction file is automatically regenerated with prioritized instructions for the current phase.\n\n### Development Rule Registration\n\nWhen receiving new conventions, rules, or constraints from users, always persist them to `project_context` instead of applying temporarily.\n\n**Pre-registration Check**:\n1. Search existing rules (`project_context read`)\n2. Check for contradictions\n3. If contradictions exist, ask user for confirmation\n\n**Important**: Once registered, rules are referenced in all subsequent sessions. Always register to prevent loss.\n\n### Self-awareness of Instructions\n\n`instructions_structure` tool modifies **this instruction file itself**. When using, explicitly state:\n\n**Cautions**:\n- Explicitly state changes when executing update/delete/insert\n- Warn that \"this instruction file will be modified\"\n- Conflict detection (`detect-conflicts`) activates automatically if external changes exist\n\n### Consistency Check with Existing Rules\n\nWhen receiving new instructions, always check for contradictions with existing `project_context`.\n\n**Check Procedure**:\n1. Search related categories (`project_context read`)\n2. If contradictions detected, present options to user\n3. Follow user choice to update or maintain existing rules\n\n### Onboarding for Existing Projects\n\nOn first run, or if existing `copilot-instructions.md` exists, analyze with `onboarding` tool.\n\n**Behavior**:\n- If compatible: Automatically operates in normal mode\n- If incompatible: Operates in restricted mode (read-only)\n- After reviewing migration proposal, execute with approval\n\n---\n\n**Current: Development Phase**\n- Register new conventions to `project_context` immediately\n- Prioritize referencing coding conventions\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Current Goals\n\n### Ultimate Objective\n**Open, Federated AI for Everyone (North Star)** (in-progress)\nEstablish an open, federated global infrastructure on XMPP where anyone can safely, affordably, and freely utilize advanced AI capabilities. Ensure accessibility (any XMPP client), transparency (visible costs/safety/reasoning), extensibility (ecosystem-driven plugin growth), sustainability (predictable economics), and public utility (protocol-based collaboration without proprietary lock-in).\n\n### 🎯 Current Focus\n**Open, Federated AI for Everyone (North Star)** (in-progress)\nEstablish an open, federated global infrastructure on XMPP where anyone can safely, affordably, and freely utilize advanced AI capabilities.
