## meta: Tool Usage Guide

This MCP server handles external storage and dynamic generation of instructions. Use the following tools appropriately.

### Development State Management

When development phase or work focus changes, always update the state with `change_context` tool.

**When to Use**:
- Phase transitions (development→testing, testing→debugging, etc.)
- Work focus changes (API implementation→authentication, etc.)

**Effect**: After state change, this instruction file is automatically regenerated with prioritized instructions for the current phase.

### Development Rule Registration

When receiving new conventions, rules, or constraints from users, always persist them to `project_context` instead of applying temporarily.

**Pre-registration Check**:
1. Search existing rules (`project_context read`)
2. Check for contradictions
3. If contradictions exist, ask user for confirmation

**Important**: Once registered, rules are referenced in all subsequent sessions. Always register to prevent loss.

### Self-awareness of Instructions

`instructions_structure` tool modifies **this instruction file itself**. When using, explicitly state:

**Cautions**:
- Explicitly state changes when executing update/delete/insert
- Warn that "this instruction file will be modified"
- Conflict detection (`detect-conflicts`) activates automatically if external changes exist

### Consistency Check with Existing Rules

When receiving new instructions, always check for contradictions with existing `project_context`.

**Check Procedure**:
1. Search related categories (`project_context read`)
2. If contradictions detected, present options to user
3. Follow user choice to update or maintain existing rules

### Onboarding for Existing Projects

On first run, or if existing `copilot-instructions.md` exists, analyze with `onboarding` tool.

**Behavior**:
- If compatible: Automatically operates in normal mode
- If incompatible: Operates in restricted mode (read-only)
- After reviewing migration proposal, execute with approval

---

**Current: Development Phase**
- Register new conventions to `project_context` immediately
- Prioritize referencing coding conventions

## 🎯 Current Goals

### Ultimate Objective
**Open, Federated AI for Everyone (North Star)** (in-progress)
Establish an open, federated global infrastructure on XMPP where anyone can safely, affordably, and freely utilize advanced AI capabilities. Ensure accessibility (any XMPP client), transparency (visible costs/safety/reasoning), extensibility (ecosystem-driven plugin growth), sustainability (predictable economics), and public utility (protocol-based collaboration without proprietary lock-in).

Ensure accessibility (any XMPP client), transparency (visible costs/safety/reasoning), extensibility (ecosystem-driven plugin growth), sustainability (predictable economics), and public utility (protocol-based collaboration without proprietary lock-in).

### Next Steps
- ⏸️ Production-Ready Federated AI Infrastructure (2028) (not-started)
